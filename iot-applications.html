    <h>IoT Applications</h>
      <ul>
        <li>Applications that connect devices so that they can communicate with each other without human intereference</li>
        <li>Features include sensors, devices, applications, user interfaces, servers, cloud, etc</li>
        <li>Examples include smart buildings, security systems, inventory management, transportation and agricuture </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h>Smart Buildings</h>
    <ul>
        <li>Smart buildings collect data about the users of the building to optimise and automate the building's functions </li>
        <li>Features include light and temperature sensors, cameras, meters, processing systems, power sources, etc</li>
        <li>Examples include temperature control, light management, hazard detection, energy optimisation, etc </li>
    </ul>
    <h>IoT Interfaces</h>
    <ul>
        <li>IoT interfaces need to show the status of sensor data and present it in a way that is intuitive for the user</li>
        <li>IoT interfaces need inputs (eg. sensors), processing, outputs (eg. actuators) and memory to function</li>
        <li>Users of these interaces include the people who live and work in the building, as well as the corporations who run them</li>
      </ul>
      <h>Examples:</h>
